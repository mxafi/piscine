Project was working properly and was semi easy to read. They managed to explain the code well and both were rely understanding about norm flag cos norm pdf clearly sad that if variable names have multiple words they should be separated whit underscore. Unfortunately one of the team members was not in the piscine anymore but they managed to do good work regardless. Keep it up and don't quit and you will pass. And enjoy while it still last ;).

We wen't through the source code and everything looked good and all team members knew what was going on. The program worked as expected except for the last error management part where the program wasn't checking for sudoku's validity and gave solution for a fake sudoku with multiple solutions. Otherwise the program behaved in sensible ways. Good job with the project!

Great work ! All good in repository, norminette and makefile ok. Good that you have protected and freed your mallocs. Good naming with variables and files. Code is structured well and all team members were able to explain it. Quite impressive work overall with solutions. And I could see you have put lot of effort in to your work. Good luck with rest of the piscine :)
